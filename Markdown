Summary
-------
This PR flattens and normalizes the repository layout for Nexa Agent so the code structure follows conventional Python project expectations. It moves key modules out of nested app/ folders into a canonical layout, moves the Dockerfile to the repository root, and places the CI workflow at .github/workflows/test.yml.

What changed
------------
- apps/
  - moved engine.py to apps/nexa_script/engine.py
  - moved router.py to apps/nexa_vision/router.py
  - moved outreach.py to apps/nexa_press/outreach.py
  - added __init__.py files where appropriate
- core/
  - moved agent_graph.py to core/agent_graph.py
  - moved guardrails.py to core/guardrails.py
- Dockerfile moved to repository root
- GitHub Actions workflow moved/created at .github/workflows/test.yml
- docs/ placed at docs/ with BRAND_GUIDE.md and STRATEGY.md
- tests/ contains a smoke test
- Branch: chore/flatten-structure

Why
---
The repository previously contained deeply nested duplicated folders (e.g., app/apps/... repeated), which made imports and CI paths brittle and non-standard. Flattening:

- simplifies imports and execution (uvicorn app.main:app)
- improves discoverability of modules for contributors
- aligns CI and Docker usage with common tooling expectations

How to test locally
-------------------
1. Ensure branch is checked out:
   git checkout chore/flatten-structure

2. (Optional) Create & activate a venv:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the app:
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload

5. Smoke test:
   pytest -q

6. Verify Docker build (optional):
   docker build -t nexa-agent .

Checklist (reviewers: please verify the items below)
- [ ] Verify moved files exist at the canonical paths:
  - apps/nexa_script/engine.py
  - apps/nexa_vision/router.py
  - apps/nexa_press/outreach.py
  - core/agent_graph.py
  - core/guardrails.py
  - app/main.py
  - Dockerfile at repo root
  - .github/workflows/test.yml at repo root
- [ ] Run pytest locally and confirm tests pass
- [ ] Confirm CI (GitHub Actions) runs successfully for this PR
- [ ] Confirm imports work (no broken relative imports)
- [ ] Confirm Dockerfile builds successfully (optional)

Notes / follow-ups
-----------------
- If there are any import errors after this restructure, comment here with the traceback and I will prepare targeted fixes (sed/patch or small code changes).
- If you’d like, I can update CI workflow to run linting and type checks (flake8 / mypy) in a follow-up PR.
